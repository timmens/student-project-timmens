# Student Project - Tim Mensinger and Florian Schoner

## Note (!!)

Some links are not working blabla this is an old repo just open the file manually.

## Abstract

In this project we try to understand newly proposed methods for computing heterogenous treatment effects that leverage regression and classification approaches from the machine learning literature. In particular we are interested in the new method *Causal Trees*, first proposed in [*Recursive partitioning for heterogeneous causal effects*](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7353),
by Susan Athey and Guido Imbens (2016); see reference below. Their method is heavily based upon the famous classification and regression tree algorithm, illustrated in the same-titled book by Breiman et al. (1984); see reference below. The project will be split in two parts. Part one, Causal Tree, will be written by Tim Mensinger, while part two, Simulation Study, will be done by Florian Schoner.

In this section we will work on a Python implementation of the algorithm (`CausalTree.py`) as well as on an illustrative notebook. The notebook will contain a concise explanation of the mathematics behind Causal Trees, along with an outlook on the use of more involved algorithms.

Here we compare common approaches to estimating treatment effects in settings with and without heterogeneity in treatment effects. For simulated data we compare the naive estimator, propensity score weighting, k-NN, OLS, and Causal Forests.<sup>1</sup>
